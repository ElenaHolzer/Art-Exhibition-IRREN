### Technical Implementation of an art exhibition
## "IRREN" at Pasinger Fabrik, Munich &nbsp;

The exhibition contained artworks of various media, such as video, audio, lights and sculptures. Instead of playing, glowing and moving all at once, we developed a kind of choreography, meaning they all had different durations, which were coordinated with eachother in a special rhythm. I programmed 14 RaspberryPis via shell/bash, wired them and connected them to the mechanics of each artwork. It took a few weeks, lots of cables and some other special devices like arduino boards and dimmer packs before everything was put togehter and ready to function as intended.
